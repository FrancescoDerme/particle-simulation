- Make the window work with F11
- Decouple physical position from graphical position (problems: convert mouse position back to physical, don't render what's not visible)
- Decouple physics from lag
- Interactivity: reset button, add constraints / points at run-time, pin points at run-time, move the cloth by hand and eventually tear it apart
- Investigate how to make the physics simulation more realistic, starting from energy dissipation / friction, then more advanced simulation techniques
- Bug / unphysical results when two constraints overlap (traingle collpase) -> probably the only way to deal with this is to handle collisions?
- Experiment with 3D? If so try templating the dimension
- Wind
- Solid objects to interact with the cloth
