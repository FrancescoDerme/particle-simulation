- Make the window work with F11
- Zoom (problems: convert mouse position back to physical, don't render what's not visible)
- Cut multiple overlapping constraints at the same time, to find relevant constraints, use spacial hashing instead of iterating over all
- Actually add graphics (points and constraints should be hidden)
- Interactivity: reset button, add constraints / points at run-time, pin points at run-time, move the cloth by hand and eventually tear it apart
- Investigate how to make the physics simulation more realistic, starting from energy dissipation / friction, then more advanced simulation techniques
- Wind and solid objects to interact with the cloth

Advanced
- Hierarchical multi-grid to achieve convergence faster (requires using multiple meshes at different resolutions and synchronizing them)
- Experiment with 3D? If so try templating the dimension
